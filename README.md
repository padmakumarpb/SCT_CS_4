# BASIC KEYLOGGER

## Keylogger Program

This keylogger tool is developed as part of my internship at SkillCraft Technology. Its primary function is to record and log keystrokes for educational purposes. The project includes the following components:

- Captures and logs all keys pressed by the user.
- Saves the recorded keystrokes to a file named `log.txt`.
- Designed to demonstrate basic keylogging functionality.

## Installation & Usage

Ensure you have Python installed. This program uses the `pynput` library to capture keystrokes.

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the required library using pip:
4. Run the program.
5. The keylogger will start logging keystrokes after you press Enter. The logged keystrokes will be saved to a file named log.txt in the project directory.

## Example

- After the security message is displayed, press Enter to start logging keystrokes.
- Type some keys on your keyboard. The program will log all keystrokes, including special keys.
- The keystrokes will be saved to log.txt. Here is an example of the file content:
    - hi ,welcomr<backspace>e to my <shift>program.
